  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;I was in Zion National Park this year, and it was awe-inspiring. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say writing is a form of mediation. Well, I always say it, and I think it’s true. Reflecting on your past and writing down your thoughts is a meditative activity because it helps you ponder on your decisions and become more self-aware. This article is my reflection on a very recent career move that I’ve made. It’s also the contemplations about my past four years at Buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently switched careers, from being a product engineer to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering&quot;&gt;site reliability engineer&lt;/a&gt; (SRE). I’ve become &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com&quot;&gt;Buffer’s&lt;/a&gt; first SRE this year and learned a lot from my experience. I want to share everything I’ve learned along the way, as well as the challenges I faced. If you’re a developer who is thinking about getting into SRE, I’m sure you will find this article very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the rare instances where I sat down one Saturday morning and finished the first draft in one sitting. There is a lot to cover, and I tried to keep it short but insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Tigran, and I’m a senior software engineer at Buffer. Buffer is a fully remote company with no office. I primarily work from home or a co-working space in NYC. I joined Buffer almost four years ago. I joined as a backend engineer to work in a team called “Buffer for Business.” We have performed a lot of team structuring after I started. My team consisted of a PM, product engineers, a designer, and a data engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Buffer, I was in a fin-tech startup based in NYC for a year, and before that, I was at school doing my MS in Computer Science. When I was at school, I did two internships, and one of them was at Twitter. I loved my time at school as I got exposed to a great environment with a bunch of smart people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after joining Buffer, I started to work on backend services that pull and store social media analytics data for our customers. We were a heavy AWS user, and as I was a novice to AWS, I learned a lot about the services running in the cloud. We were using Elastic Beanstack for all our environments, and I got to deploy my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests&quot;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; on my first day. It felt amazing to run a Slack command that could deploy my Github PR to our production servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a backend engineer, I worked mostly with PHP and Javascript. I wanted to learn as much as possible about our infrastructure. How was the build system set up on Jenkins, and who wrote the Slack bot that could do things for engineers? How could I spin up a new EC2 instance in our infrastructure? I had so many questions that made me excited about my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, over time, I transitioned into a full-stack engineering role working with React/Redux and our PHP API. I had to teach myself React so I could help my co-workers build &lt;a href=&quot;http://buffer.com/analyze&quot;&gt;Buffer Analyze&lt;/a&gt;. It was a brand new product that we were planning to launch as part of our multi-product vision. It felt like I was in a startup with a fast pace turnaround and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a full-stack engineer also helped me make strides on my side-projects. I could finally build things from zero to production and not struggle with state management or Javascript code. When I started my career, I thought I wanted to be a specialist. My view has changed over time, and I started to grasp the power of being a generalist and how much impact and influence I could have on the company. One day, I could build interactive charts with React and the other day deploy a backend &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/&quot;&gt;SQS&lt;/a&gt; worker or look up the right format of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crontab.cronhub.io/&quot;&gt;Cron schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breaking down the monolith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early to mid-2016, we decided to break down our monolithic application into multiple services and embrace Kubernetes. We were confident that it would allow us to move faster and align our engineering work with the multi-product vision we had as a company. At that time, we have worked and had good experience with Docker. &lt;a href=&quot;http://docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; entirely powered our local dev environment, and we moved away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vagrantup.com/&quot;&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this was in 2016, Kubernetes wasn’t as popular and mainstream as it is now. We knew we were throwing ourselves into a completely new world that has a lot of uncertainties and open questions. We knew that we would face technical challenges that we never encountered before. I remember our CTO Dan, and I would attend local k8s meetups to see how other engineering teams solved problems that we were so keen to find answers for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the whole microserver transition part was incremental and involved a lot of experimentation and mistakes. Even with mistakes, looking back now, it turned out to be the right decision. I think, most importantly, we never stopped iterating on our infrastructure and making it more reliable and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we decided to transition from AWS to Kubernetes, I was one of the early pioneers to advocate for this change. As a product engineer, I saw the value we would get if we could break down our analytics infrastructure into microservices. We could use Kubernetes to orchestrate and manage our entire cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to separate our Analytics API from the main Buffer API so we could move faster and make our own technical decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to build a separate build and CI/CD pipeline for our team so we could move faster. Our deployments would take 4-5 minutes on average, and often it would slow us down. We needed to move faster as a small team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to have a fast roll-back mechanism in place, so in case something went wrong, I could revert my changes quickly. This process would give engineers more confidence and improve our velocity.
Even if we broke something, it wouldn’t impact the rest of the products at Buffer. The impact of an incident would be minor because we were building a new product with a low number of paying customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to not worry about scaling, and even if I had to, it would be just a quick command run from my fancy themed terminal. Kubernetes makes it a breeze to scale your services up and down. It also supports autoscaling based on native and external metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other benefits I could mention here, but I don’t want this list to go on for too long. Instead, I want to focus now on the challenges that created an opportunity for a brand new role at Buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why make a role switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until early 2019, I continued to be part of the Buffer Analyze team. I helped my team to move our Analytics data infrastructure from AWS to Kubernetes. We started to build our new features on top of our new cloud infrastructure and launch the product for the public. It was an exciting time to see new users praise Buffer Analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this didn’t come without the new challenges we started to face as a team. The move from monolithic to microservice architecture increased our infrastructure complexity by several orders of magnitude. The transition introduced major complex problems that one would face working with distributed systems. We needed to think about networking, observability, deployments, and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, this meant that product engineering teams had to solve some of these common problems instead of focusing on building great products for our customers. This complexity reduced product engineering productivity and team velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this created a need to have a new type of engineer(s) who could be embedded into product teams. This role would help engineers to implement reliability oriented features and educate them about operational best practices, automation, monitoring, and observability. These engineers are usually called SREs (Site Reliability Engineers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I loved working with developers. I started my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cronhub.io&quot;&gt;side-project&lt;/a&gt; last year to help developers with Cron job monitoring. My work at Buffer and my personal project helped me to discover my passion for developer productivity and tools. I also knew that I enjoyed being a backend generalist and working on infrastructure type of projects more. I loved writing code but also enjoyed understanding how complex distributed systems work. It’s not a coincidence that I took mainly database and distributed systems courses at RIT and specialized in databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering my professional interests and the needs of the company, I decided to write a pitch document. I named the document “Tigran’s role change motivation” and shared it with our engineering leadership. Of course, it wasn’t that sudden. I had prior calls with my manager and co-workers, openly sharing the motivation behind my role change. I’m very grateful that we have a very open culture at Buffer, and I felt very supported throughout the entire process of my role transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of discussion and working closely with my manager, we created a role transition plan for me. It was a one- to three-month plan during which I would hand my responsibilities to a newly hired engineer. We also worked together to define what my new role would be in the infrastructure team. We never had an SRE before, so as the first SRE at Buffer, I had to think deeply about my roadmap and future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two months of preparation and hard work, I gradually handed all my product engineering responsibilities to the product engineer who replaced me in my old team. I was lucky he picked up things very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August of 2019, I was a full-time Site Reliability Engineer at Buffer as a part of the infrastructure team. Our team consists of four engineers and one engineering manager. It’s already been three months full of all kinds of emotions and learnings. I got started with my projects, met my new team in person in our product-engineering summit, and started taking more SRE responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I’m working on as an SRE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite often, I see people wondering and asking questions about an SRE’s role in an organization. I don’t think there is a definite answer as the role varies in companies. However, I believe there are common projects that most SREs work on as part of their role. At least, that’s what I learned by talking to other SREs in our industry and attending tech conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I like being a generalist, I work across the entire stack of infrastructure. I like juggling multiple projects at the same time; it makes my work more fun and exciting. Working on a vast range of technical problems helps me create mental models that come in handy when thinking about large systems. I like working on various projects because I can use this practice to see the broad picture of the problems I’m trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually decide what I should work on, but I always consult with my manager. I think as one grows into a more senior role, this becomes inevitable. One does a lot more thinking and less coding. I always try to work on impactful projects, and this was, in part, why I wanted to switch my role. In this way, I could expand my scope of influence at the company. Every problem I tackle is most likely to impact all engineers across multiple teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of our team is to make product teams more successful. We treat product teams as our customers. This mindset helps to measure the impact of the projects. Of course, there are urgent tasks that come in occasionally. Still, our goal is to build a reliable infrastructure that gives us a space to work on non-urgent but important projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I working on these days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, my main focus is to solve the common engineering operation challenges with developer tooling. I’m trying to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datadog.com&quot;&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugsnag.com&quot;&gt;Bugsnag&lt;/a&gt; as useful for engineers as possible. We use these tools extensively at Buffer. However, to get the most value from developer tools, one should invest in building the right processes and educate engineers about the workflows that these tools could come in useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of improving these workflows is enormous. Imagine if you could build a great system that helps engineers to debug requests faster. If you improve this process by even 10%, that’s 10% times the number of engineers you have in your organization. Now it becomes impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a site reliability engineer, I’m also always thinking about our incident management and how we could improve the existing process. We have a robust on-call schedule in place, but we don’t have proper run-books yet. We do incident write-ups. I think these write-ups are immensely useful for engineers for learning and knowledge share. I’m very optimistic we can use these write-ups to create our runbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fun project I’m working on right now is building a Redis Web UI proxy for our engineers. We use Redis at Buffer for many things, and I think we should make it observable for engineers. My idea is to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander&quot;&gt;Redis Commander&lt;/a&gt; on a Docker container and expose it as an internal tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have plenty of future exciting projects on my roadmap. One of them is implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective&quot;&gt;SLOs&lt;/a&gt; (Service Level Objectives) for our core services. SLOs are vital for us because they can support our data-driven decisions about reliability. They are the core of SRE practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think that SREs are on-call all the time and don’t usually sleep. Even though it’s helpful when they are around during an incident, they are not required to be. Our goal is to figure out the best practices that help engineers take the right action during an incident. We provide the necessary tools, docs, and environment for incident handling. Incident management can be stressful for any engineer, and it’s critical to have it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my new role, I get to work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kubernetes.io&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; more extensively. Kubernetes is a cloud technology that I’m particularly excited about because I believe it opens up new opportunities for us to build great things on top of it. I wrote about this topic in detail in another &lt;a href=&quot;https://tik.dev/k8s-is-great&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. What I think we should do is to build high-level abstractions on top of Kubernetes to hide all the hidden complexities of the system. It can make developers’ lives easier. I see a future where we have plenty of public-facing and internal tools that we built on top of Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my projects involve extensive communication and collaboration with the rest of the engineers. Working with engineers, understanding their daily challenges, and finding the right solutions for them is incredibly rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any new role, there are many things I don’t know. That’s a good thing because I like to learn and fill my knowledge gaps. I thought it would be useful to write about the skills I aspire to acquire as part of my role as an SRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I don’t know as an SRE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run a large distributed system, and it comes with challenges we’ve never faced before. One of the reasons I like being an SRE is that it exposes me to a wide range of problems. Now, all the theories I learned in my distributed systems classes at school started to make sense. Knowing the theory and how to apply it in a real work application is an important skill. The challenge is to identify the problem and find the right theory behind it so you can come up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did much reading on how to get into SRE. I wanted to know what to expect as part of my new role when it comes to the technical skills that I needed to acquire. I’ve found that there are multiple skill areas that the SRE domain covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operation systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that this is a lot. Even though being an SRE meant being a broad problem solver, most SREs tend to specialize in one or two of these skills. When you have multiple SREs in one company, you can distribute these skills into multiple buckets depending on engineers’ interests and expertise. When it comes to learning these skills, I try to go breadth-first until it becomes overwhelming. If I had to specialize in something, it would probably be databases, software engineering, and operation systems (OS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to become an SRE, then I highly recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/&quot;&gt;Alice Goldfuss’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/how-to-get-into-sre/&quot;&gt;How to get into SRE&lt;/a&gt; blog post. It’s a vast assortment of resources you can find useful. I’ve found it to be the most useful resource apart from the well-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/sre/books/&quot;&gt;Google’s SRE books&lt;/a&gt;. I use the book as more of a reference, depending on the problem I’m currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a reliability engineer, which implies that I should be an expert in reliability. However, I’m not, and it scares me a bit. If you asked me to define what the reliable and production-ready service is right now, I might be able to recall fuzzy sentences. I want to learn and know all the big and essential ideas behind the reliable and scalable distributed systems. It sounds fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability is a broad term, and it can mean anything, really. However, there is one definition I’m very fond of that I’d like to quote here. It’s from one of the best technical books I’ve read, &lt;em&gt;Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann&lt;/em&gt;. It defines reliability as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all those things together mean “working correctly,” then we can understand reliability as meaning, roughly, “continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that could go wrong is a hardware fault, software fault, or a human error. Our goal should be to work with engineers to build systems that anticipate these faults and cope with them. The author calls them fault-tolerant and resilient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I consider myself a product-minded person, I’ve always worked with Product Managers (PM) to define the scope and story of the technical projects. We don’t have a PM in the infrastructure team, so I’m learning to be my own PM and mull over each I idea before I start working on it. I also started to wonder whether it’s common not to have PMs in infrastructure teams. I don’t have a clear answer here, but I think it might be useful in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big chunk of the work I do is operational and involves driving engineering change in multiple teams. Even though I like working with a wide range of engineers, being a pioneer of a new engineering process and convincing engineers to adopt a new process is quite challenging. I think that, apart from the technical skills, it requires leadership, clear communication, and sales. In some cases, you should be very persistent with the process you introduce if you believe there is a clear value for it. I’m working on improving these skills so I can become a better advocate for good practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I think I’m trying to be okay with not knowing everything. I ask questions, read, and try to become better every day at work. I also make sure not to overwhelm myself with the extensive knowledge available on the Internet. It’s essential to keep a free mental capacity so you can digest everything you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a software engineer who is thinking of getting into SRE, then I’m excited for you. SRE is a new discipline and is still actively evolving. Some people are confused about how SRE is different from traditional DevOps engineers. I relate to this question, but maybe it’s a topic for another blog post. In general, if you enjoy working with distributed systems and building reliable platforms for engineers to innovate, then the SRE might be a good fit for you. Most SRE problems are open-ended and require consistent progress towards the goal. There are some days, or even weeks when you might end up not writing a single line of code. You should be okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey of being an SRE is short, and there is so much I don’t know yet. However, I can’t wait to see what the future has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; (k8s) for a couple of years now, and very recently, I started to reason about its deep purpose and potential for the future of software. I think the way we’re building software now is going to change in the future fundamentally. With the rise of cloud technology, all the tools we use now might move to the cloud. This transition makes me think if the next significant innovation in programming languages connects to cloud innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we build a new programming language that runs on the cloud? Why do we have to duplicate the same codebase in our local machine and the cloud? Do we need the tools like git to keep them in sync? Can we remove the friction between the code that engineers write and the production release? I have more questions buried in my head that make me thrilled to see what the future has to surprise us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to share my quick thoughts about Kubernetes and why I think it’s an exciting technology for our ecosystem and the future of building software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The infrastructure becomes more innovative and less scary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how intimidating infrastructure and DevOps type of work is for most developers, particularly for people who are entering the field. I think even experienced engineers sometimes struggle to wrap their heads around deployments, servers, networking, and more. I’m optimistic we can eradicate the complexity of infrastructure by building high-level abstractions on top of Kubernetes. We still need to build backend services, but it won’t be hard anymore because using the agility of Kubernetes, we can make more visual and user-friendly tools. We can treat infrastructure as LEGO and construct anything we want by combining different bricks. Instead of writing long bash scripts or server receipts to provision servers, we can build visual editors in the cloud that allow us to create backend services and make complex pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Far more people become makers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than 1% of the world’s population currently knows how to write software. Does one have to know how to code to make things for computers? I don’t think so. We now have no-code tools that we can use to make websites and software. No-code tools are very promising because they empower more people to become makers from diverse backgrounds. We want more creators and entrepreneurs for world innovation and good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, most of the no-code tools are designed to reduce the obstacles for frontend development and automation tools. I want to see such tools for building complicated backend services too. It’s still a pain to write, deploy, and scale backend infrastructures. With the help of Kubernetes, we can address this challenge. We can build no-code tools that run on Kubernetes. Creating, scaling, and rolling back backend services won’t be stressful anymore. We can finally not feel guilty for Friday deploys.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@herlifeinpixels?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot; target=&quot;_href&quot;&gt;Hannah Wei&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, I started to actively entertain my aspiration of becoming financially independent and living life the way I wanted to. My goal was to build assets that could make money while I sleep. I decided not to master any new skills but rather use my coding skills to develop new sources of income. Of course, like any other developer, I also happened to have a list of product ideas that I had created. After comparing each idea in the list with my requirement checklist, I realized that none of the ideas would work. They all sounded cool, but none of them could make money from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after two years, I have multiple sources of income. In this blog post, I share some of the ideas that I think any developer could pursue to make more money online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may ask why I would want to spend my free time doing more work. It’s a fair question. In the long run, I want financial freedom and the freedom to choose what I want to work on. Freedom and work flexibility are my highest values because they will allow me to spend my mental energy on things that are deeply important to me. If I rely only on my weekly paychecks, I may be able to build a financial safety net but not the life I want. Living from paycheck to paycheck is limiting us since we rent our time for money, and time is static. You can’t add more hours to a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second motivation is not financial. I also think a lot about the developer economy and how the way we make money now will change. In the late ʼ80s and early ʼ90s we got paid by producing code and that was the only output we could sell. Then, over time, it changed. We started to sell our skills by renting our time to businesses. We got paid for our time. Are we going to continue renting our time or, with the rise of individualism and personal branding, will we see a different trend? The Internet enables us to create new careers online, and we should utilize its power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things you can do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have shared my rationale, I’d like to address the ideas that I think you can start exploring today. All these ideas require substantial time investment in the beginning, but I think you can do them on the side while keeping your current job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Become an online instructor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know how to code and love teaching, then becoming an online instructor is a great way to enhance your income. The online education market is expanding and is expected to hit to $325B in 2025. The potential is enormous, and many students see online education as a viable alternative to traditional institutions. Luckily for developers, the Internet opens new doors to becoming a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become an online instructor, ask yourself what skills you could teach to others. It can be any technology that you know well and can confidently share with the rest of the world. There are many online platforms where you can sign up as an instructor. I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://egghead.io&quot;&gt;Egghead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://udemy.com&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://skillshare.com&quot;&gt;Skillshare&lt;/a&gt; provide the tools you need to host a course and get paid. Most of these educational platforms may charge you for each sale you make on their platform, but that’s fair because of the students they find for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create an online course&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to pay a fee to a third-party service or if you want to own your content, then you can create and host your online course. Apart from creating educational video content, you should also be good at marketing. If you already have an audience, then this path might be a great option since you can count on your viewers. Building an audience is hard and requires consistent commitment. However, long term, the rewards are great. When you have an online presence, there are many prospects for monetizing it. You worked hard to build your audience, and I don’t think you should feel apologetic for utilizing it. Your audience support you to support them with your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t host your course on any of the existing platforms, then you need to build a course website where you can upload your content and charge for it. The simplest and probably the best e-commerce software you can use for charging your customers is Gumroad. I’ve never used it, but I know many creators who love it. If you want to focus only on the content and not deal with any other process, then use &lt;a href=&quot;https://teachable.com&quot;&gt;Teachable&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an online service that provides everything you need to create and sell online courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Write an e-book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer writing words to creating a video, then you can write an e-book and sell it online. The good thing is you don’t need a professional publisher. Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/098-adam-wathan-of-refactoring-ui&quot;&gt;creators&lt;/a&gt; I know successfully self-published books online. Writing a book requires a considerable time commitment; however, it can quickly turn to a passive income. Most educational books continue selling for a couple of years until they are outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that the book market is crowded, then try to be a big fish in a small pond. Find your niche market where you can have a voice. Look for the intersection of the many skills you have. As an example, if you’re a PHP developer who knows Kubernetes well, you can write a book for PHP developers who want to learn Kubernetes. Now you know your target audience, and it will help you to market it effectively. Gumroad makes it very easy to sell your e-book online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a native English speaker, then why not to write a book in your native language first and discover if you like the writing process. It’s always better to take small steps first. Do not expect that your book will make millions overnight. Set the right expectations, but still believe in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build a software as a service (SaaS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building software that you can charge for is challenging but might be the most rewarding in the long haul. It requires steady work. If you’re a product-minded person who also enjoys working on business problems, then you will enjoy this. If you don’t know anything about building a business but want to learn, then creating an online business is the most accelerated learning path you can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain of problems you will work on is immense. To start my journey of financial freedom, I chose this path and started my &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io&quot;&gt;side-business&lt;/a&gt; last year. It has generated around $8000 revenue so far and become a stable source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to find a product idea is to solve a problem you personally have. It can be something you experience at work or in daily life. When you’re your own customer, you know precisely what your next feature should be. I have written many articles about my journey of building an SaaS business, but reading my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tik.dev/lessons-learned&quot;&gt;reflection as a solo-founder article&lt;/a&gt; might be the best one there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a good idea and building it is not enough. You need a product that can become a business. You have to find people who will pay for the service you provide. Ask yourself, what’s one product you wish existed and you would pay for? Go ahead and build it. It doesn’t have to be a life-changing idea or even a new idea. Remember, we are not looking to start the new Facebook. I would always start from a niche product and then expand from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paid newsletters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that this one is very dear to my heart. As I love writing and building software, I want to find the intersection of these dimensions where I could make a full-time living. I could probably write a book about building software, but that’s not too exciting yet. However, I can start a paid newsletter where my readers can support my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; is trying this model, allowing many creators to start paid publications. The quality and curated content discovery is becoming more critical but challenging every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start a paid newsletter and write about your niche. If you charge $10 and find 200 avid readers, you can make $2000 per month. I think the key here is focusing on the quality and ignoring the quantity. If you don’t have an existing audience, it might be challenging to get this off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open-source projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a developer who maintains an open-source project, then you can monetize it and get financial support for the work you do. I think this is still a new trend in our industry, but it has a huge potential because a large part of our current digital infrastructure is built upon open-source software. The community of developers who make open-source software used by many companies should get paid fairly. Even though introducing payments might change the dynamics of open-source software, I think financial support is the only way to keep it sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have open-source software, then you can start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; account to get paid. You can make predictable recurring revenue on Patreon by introducing membership tiers. Github just recently added &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sponsors&quot;&gt;Github Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easier to support your favorite developers. Since Github is the biggest social network of developers, I hope this trend will become more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an open-source project, then you can start one. Building and maintaining an open-source project is a high leverage job and might be one of the best ways to meet like-minded people, expand your professional network, and find your next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I shared above is not an exhaustive list. I’m sure I’ve missed many ideas. Working on one idea from the list mentioned above should not stop you from trying others. In fact, I plan to experiment with some of the ideas here. Trying many things is the best heuristic for finding the work you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, we’re fortunate to live in these times. There is a vast opportunity in front of us to innovate, try many things, and find the work that makes us happy. The barrier to starting something online is low, and we all should take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once a month or so, I send out an email with my latest writing, thoughts, or anything interesting that I’ve read. If you want to stay in touch then &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/tigranh&quot;&gt;you can subscribe&lt;/a&gt; and receive my writing in your inbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to support my work, the best thing you can do is to share it with your friends. Thank you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[🏝 Remote Work “Office Hours”]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I’m excited to announce my new initiative - Remote Work “Office Hours.” I will be dedicating 2-3 hours every week (20 min time slots) to answer your questions about working remotely as a developer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE August 27, 2019: I’m pausing the office hours due to the demand. I don’t want to go too far in the calendar. I will resume when I finish the calls in this cycle. Thanks for understanding! :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tik.dev&quot;&gt;Tigran&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m a software engineer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;. Buffer is a remote company with no office. I’ve been working remotely for almost four years now and learned a lot about remote work. Last year I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/free-code-camp/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer-757465ed1e9e&quot;&gt;popular article&lt;/a&gt; where I shared my reflections on being a remote developer. In my free time, I like playing soccer, writing, and working on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io&quot;&gt;side-project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This year I traveled to Kauai island and worked from there. It was incredible. Very grateful I can do things like this with remote work flexibility. &amp;#x2764;&amp;#xFE0F; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why “office hours”?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing my article about remote work, I started to receive many emails asking questions about my experience of being a remote developer. I hope I can help and share everything I know and learned about remote work. I know it’s a significant lifestyle change when you decide to work remotely, and I hope to help even a little to ease that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who should attend?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a developer, and I base my remote experience on the type of work I do every day. Knowing what I know, I think I can be the most helpful to people who are in tech and especially developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a group of people that I have in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers who are not sure whether remote work will be a good fit for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers who work remotely and want to be better at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers who want to find a remote job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the structure of the “Office Hours”?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please introduce yourself first. Like any other “office hours” I expect you to come with your questions and I’ll try to answer them the best I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I sign up?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab an available time slot on my &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/tigranh/remote-work-office-hours-with-tigran&quot;&gt;Calendly schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;All calls will be video calls on &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Please make sure you downloaded and installed Zoom prior our calls&lt;/strong&gt;. The meeting link will be in the calendar invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much time do I have?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to keep it for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you doing this by yourself?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. However, I might have surprise guests on some days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do I have to pay for this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It’s completely free.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why You Should Start Writing]]></title><description><![CDATA[Less than two years ago, I had almost zero published articles with no audience of readers.

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than two years ago, I had almost zero published articles with no audience of readers. I had hardly written any articles in English, and even if I had, they were part of the curriculum I took at school. However, this never stopped me considering myself an aspiring writer. I knew I liked writing a lot and always wanted to share my thoughts with everyone. My biggest challenge was not knowing where and how to start. I was lost because I thought I had nothing original to share with the world. This was a big blocker until I published my first article. The response from my readers was very supportive and encouraging. I realized what readers are looking for is not necessarily new ideas, but rather, a new interpretation of already familiar concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revelation helped me tremendously to keep writing in public. Writing has been life-changing for me because it helped me to become more self-aware, find my professional focus, and meet great people on the web. I hope to inspire you to start the journey of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use writing almost everywhere as a way to communicate. However, written communication is not extensively discussed—at least, not as much as verbal communication. We have much praise for public speaking but barely talk about the benefits of public writing, even though in some workplaces we write more than we talk. If we think that remote work is the future, then writing becomes one of the most valuable tools for effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-discovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the best way to become a self-aware person is to start writing. Nothing else provides more opportunities to learn about yourself. When you make writing a habit, you start noticing patterns that you continuously fall into. This helps you to unlock your personality, and it’s powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always produce” is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you’re supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. “Always produce” will discover your life’s work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof. – “How to do what you love” - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have friends and co-workers who meditate regularly to clear their mind and find inner tranquility. Writing is a form of meditation. Being alone with your words helps you stay focused for a while. Staying focused is challenging; we humans are easily distracted. When you write, there is no outside; everything fits perfectly, and your body and mind speak a common language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sharing knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet is one of the most significant advantages we have over the previous generation, and we should leverage it. I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrickc&quot;&gt;Patrick Collison&lt;/a&gt; once tweeted that the biggest leverage a human can build in the world comes from teaching others to do the same. Sharing our knowledge with each other makes the world a better place. Talent is equally distributed across the world, but opportunities are not, which means that we can build new opportunities for others by sharing what we already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to understand the power of the network. Many things become a lot easier when you have a big network of people who are willing to help and support you. Humans are inherently kind to each other, so why don’t we use it to our advantage? Writing is a great way to build a network of friends and acquaintances. Since I started blogging regularly, I have received many kind emails from strangers. Some of them are my friends now, and we’re in touch frequently. Writing helps you to build an audience and it becomes a great medium for you to find friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expediting your career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a strong online presence and relationships with others on the internet helps tremendously with finding your next job or gig. I haven’t found a better way to build that presence than writing in public. Start a blog because it’s a better way to show off your skills than your resume.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I decided to start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io&quot;&gt;side-project&lt;/a&gt; so I could have a second source of income. I thought that building a side-business would help me gain skills that I’d not otherwise acquire in my current job. It would be a year full of joy and disappointment, but little did I know that it would also turn out to be the best year for my personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into writing, found my true professional passion, generated around $4000 net revenue, and met great people who inspired and helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/index/&quot;&gt;a couple of articles about my side-business&lt;/a&gt; in the past, I decided to switch the focus of this story and talk about the biggest lessons I’ve learned while building Cronhub. These lessons helped me to develop valuable mental models that I still use to make better decisions for my product. I think some of these lessons might be confronting for you, so please take these with a grain of salt as they’re based solely on my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why to have a side-project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a full-time job, the chances are low that the work you do daily is portable. Having a side-project is a great opportunity for you to expose yourself to and build an audience. One reason some people prefer to work on Open Source Software (OSS) is because it’s a transferable asset—when you change jobs, you don’t lose what you have produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a side-project is a great way to learn new skills, and to showcase and sell your skills to future clients and employers. If you can code, then building a side-project is a great way to make something from scratch and get experience with technical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why to have a side-business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re based in America (or even somewhere else), you probably already know that most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. I’m not judging anyone who chooses to live this lifestyle. However, I want assets that earn money while I sleep and not rent my time my whole life. If you’re like me, you value financial and personal freedom and seek ways to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen a path that is less risky. I started a business on the side without quitting my full-time job. It’s possible that when my own business provides enough income, I will work on it full-time. Also, building something valuable that other people are willing to pay is a great feeling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be your own user&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you lack ideas, solving your own problem can be a good way to build something other people want. If you have the X problem,  it’s very likely other people have the same problem. When you’re your own user, you have a huge advantage: many things suddenly become much easier, such as what to build next or how to understand your product market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Launching your business is just one milestone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many times I’ve seen people start something but never finish it. That’s why I praise people who actually launch something. When you start a project, you always think that finishing and launching your project is the hardest part. However, after the launch you realize that the most difficult part is just ahead. It’s where the actual work comes in. “If you build it, they will come” is a myth. You have to acquire your users, however you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not having a co-founder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a solo founder is hard, but it has a silver lining. The communication cost of making decisions and shipping something is extremely low. Do not let people tell you that you need a co-founder to build a successful business. I have many examples of solo founders building million-dollar companies. Of course, having a co-worker might make things much easier, but finding someone who is natural fit as your business partner is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raising money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand people who start a business to become their own boss but end up raising a ton of money from investors. You report to investors and they impact your decisions and, consequently, the direction of the company. It’s not a binary choice, and you can still build a successful business without raising a penny. Whether you need to raise money depends on your ultimate goal. If you want to build a hyper-growth company with hundreds of millions of revenue, then raising money might be a better choice. However, if you prefer to have a small team with full autonomy, then focus on making your business profitable and not on raising money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build a sustainable distribution channel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a solo founder, I strongly suggest you invest heavily in building a sustainable distribution channel for your product. It could be optimizing for SEO or launching your product apps in different marketplaces. In the long run, building constant exposure for your product will help you to focus more on building and less on marketing it. This is important especially for single founders for whom finding enough time is always the biggest challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treat pricing as any other feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not invest too much time early on designing the perfect pricing model for your product.  As with any feature on your product, it’s okay to iterate on your pricing table and change it over time.
Support yearly plans because you will be surprised how many customers prefer the yearly plan if it includes a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about your business and sharing your learnings with your audience is worth your time. Writing helps you to promote your work and expand your network. Regardless of whether your business succeeds or fails, you won’t lose your audience and it’s a great foundation for your next thing. Writing is also a great exercise for self-discovery. When you write, you become more self-aware and start to better understand your strengths and weaknesses. When you’re more self-aware, you become better at delegating your tasks and it helps your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sell your story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often I see people using X products because of their stories. Some of my customers are my loyal readers who want to support me and my project. In fact, writing this article is one way of selling my story. Being good at sales is invaluable. Many developers are intimidated by sales, especially introverts. However, if you read To Sell is Human, you learn that you don’t have to be an extrovert to be good at sales. There are many ways to get into sales, and it doesn’t have to be cold calling or emailing. Writing, storytelling, or speaking at conferences are great ways to sell your personal brand and your products. Maybe start from there to build leverage and become better at sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s okay to feel down sometimes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be days, even weeks, when you’re unproductive and don’t make any progress. It’s always been a riddle for me, and I don’t think there is a magic formula for getting out of it. Sadly, the only solution I’ve found so far is to wait for the fog to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally ask yourself whether you’re working on the most important task. Often we deviate from the right path and asking this question helps you to remedy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define and measure your product metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s vital, especially early on, to define the success metrics for your business. When you define and measure them, you can easily track your progress and build trust on your decisions. If your goal is to increase the conversion rate, then build tunnels and see which one sticks more. Running experiments early on should be part of any business. There is always uncertainty, and coming up with solutions is what makes the challenge of building your business so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t reprioritize your tasks too often&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit I have made this mistake many times, but I have learned my lesson. Don’t change your product roadmap based on a single user feedback. Try to notice patterns. Only when you’re sure that it’s the right thing to work on, start building. It’s important to find the balance between the features you think you should be working on and what your users think you should be working on. Over time, most founders develop improved intuition and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask for what you want&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough the importance of asking for what you want. Seek help, and don’t be shy. If you need advice, ask. Most people are generous and love helping others. I use email and Twitter to connect with people I admire and follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading and watching stories of other makers is only for inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading stories like this one or stories about other makers building profitable products will inspire you. You’re the one who should make the steps. Believe in yourself, but, most importantly, believe in your work. Self-belief is the key to success in anything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Սեփական կարծիք ունենալու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Վստահաբար եմ ասում, որ միայն վերջին երեք կամ չորս տարիների ընթացքում եմ ես սկսել իմ սուբյեկտիվ կարծիքը կազմել աշխարհում ինչ-որ երևացող ու չերևացող երևույթների շուրջ: Դրանից առաջ  ընդունում էի աշխարհն անյպես ինչպես իմ շրջապատն էր ընդունում՝ առանց որևէ հարցեր տալու: Սակայան հասկացա, որ սեփական կարծիք ունենալ աշխարհի մասին ու ինչպես է աշխարհն աշխատում անչափ կարևոր է մարդու ապրելու ու զարգացման համար: Կարևոր է, որովհետև կարծիք կազմելու համար պետքա է ինքդ քեզ հարցեր տալ իսկ դա օգնում է քեզ որ մտածես ու ժամանակ ծախսես հասկանալու բաներ, որ դու դեռ չգիտես: Դա քեզ օգնում է, որ դու սովորես սրա ու նրա մասին ու զարգացնես քո մտավոր ունակությունները: Դրա համար փորձիր հետաքրքրասեր մնալ, քանի որ դա է ոսկե բանալին միշտ աշակերտ մնալու:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Բաց ու փակ մարդկանց մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Փակ մարդիկ ունեն կարծիք ու երբեք չեն էլ փորձում այն փոխելու մասին: Փակ մարդիկ միշտ մտածում են, որ իրենք ճիշտ են ու չեն ընդունում ուրիշների կարծիքը: Ավելի լավ է եղիր բաց, ունեցիր քո կարծիքը բայց նաև մի փակիր քո մտքի փականները: Երբ ուրիշը տարբեր է մտածում քեզնից ավելի լավ է հարցրու ինքդ քեզ ինչն է ստիպում այդ մարդուն քեզնից տարբեր մտածել: Միայն բաց լինելով է, որ կարող ես քո աշխարահայացը ընդլայնել:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ընտանիքի ու ընկերների մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Չկա ավելի կարևոր բան քան քո ընտանիքն ու ընկերները: Հետաքրքիր է, ինչքան մեծանում այնքան շատ ես հասկանում ու զգում սրա կարևորությունը քո կյանքում: Առանց կարևոր մարդկանց դու մի տեսակ դատարկ ես կամ լցված ես բայց փուչիկի պես, որ ծավալ ունի բայց անքաշ է: Դրա համար մեծացրու քո քաշը քո հարազատ մարդկանցով:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Սովորելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Փորձիր անընդհատ նոր բաներ սովորել: Դպրոցը կամ համալսարանը ուղղակի սկիզբն են հիմնական դպրոցի որտեղ դու ես և’ քո ուսուցիչը, և’ աշակերտը. Եթե դպրոցում ես, լավ սովորի բոլոր առարկաները: Ես քանի որ դեռ դպրոցում արդեն որոշել էի ծրագրավորող դառնալ գրեթե միայն կենտրոնացել էի մաթեմատիկայի և ֆիզիկայի մեջ, քանի որ մտածում էի որ մնացած առարկաները պետք չեն գա ինձ ապագայում: Շատ սխալ էի ես այդ ժամանակ, քանի որ հիմա երբ հետ եմ նայում իմ ամենօրյա կյանքին պատմությունը, աշխարհագրությունը կամ կենսաբանությունը ավելի շատ են պետք գալիս քան են առարկաները որոնց վրա կենտրոնացել էի ժամանակին: Ճիշտ կլնի կարծում եմ կարևորել բոլորը առարկաները հավասար որ բազմակողմանի զարգանաս:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ես կարծում եմ շատ ավելի լավ է շատ բաների մասին քիչ բան իմանաս քան քիչ բաների մասին շատ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Համալսարանը շատ լավ հնարավորություն է ոչ միայն կրթություն ստանալու այլ նաև լավ ընկերներ ձեռք բերելու: Գրեթե բոլոր իմ մոտիկ ընկերները համալսարանական տարիներից են:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Երբ ուսանող ես կենտրոնացիր միայն դասերիդ վրա մնացած բաների ժամանակ դեռ կունենաս:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Որոշումներ կայացնելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Կյանքում հաճախ է լինում երբ պետք է կարևոր որոշումներ կայացնես: Որպեսզի լավացնես քո՝ լավ որոշում կայացնելու արվեստը, պետք է իմանաս շատ բաների մասին: Երբ ուղեղդ բազմակողմանի է զարգացած դա շատ ավելի հեշտ է, քանի որ կյանքում ամեն ինչ գրեթե կախված է իրարից: Երբ շատ բան գիտես ավելի լավ պատկերացում ունես թե ինչպես է աշխարհն աշխատում ու դրա համար հենց դա լավ որոշում կայացնելու հիմանական բանալին է:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Աշխատելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ցավոք հաճախ մարդիկ ավելի շատ ժամանակ են ծախսում աշխատելու վրա քան մտածելու թե ինչ են ուզում աշխատել: Քանի որ մեր կյանքի մեկ-երրորդ մասը մենք ծախսում ենք աշխատանքի վրա անչափ կարևոր է ինքներս մեզ հարցնենք թե մենք ինչ ենք սիրում անել և որ աշխատանքը մեզ ավելի կերջանկացնի (իհարկե եթե դրա հնարավորությունը կա):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Եթե ուզում ես հաջողակ լինել քո գործում պետքա սիրես այն, ցավոք չկա ուրիշ ճանապարհ: Եթե չսիրես քո գործը ի՞նչն է քեզ ոգևորելու, որ չհանձնվես երբ դժվարությունների մեջ լինես: Դու ես քո շարժիչը ու դրա համար լավ մտածի թե ինչի վրա ես ուզում ծախսել քո սահմանափակ էներգիան ու ժամանակը.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ինքդ քեզ հավատալու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Եթե ինքդ քեզ չհավատաս շատ դժվար կլինի ուրիշներին ստիպել որ քեզ հավատան: Հաճախ կյանքում շատ հաջողություններ կախված են նրանից, թե դու ինչքան լավ ես ուրիշներին համոզում էն ինչին դու ինքդ ես հավատում: Դրա համար կարևոր է, որ աշխատես ու ապրես այն արժեքներով որին դու իրոք սրտանց հավատում ես:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Քո կողքի մարդկանց մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Սա անչափ կարևոր է: Դու դառնում ես այն 5 մարդկանց միջինը ում հետ ամենաշատն ես ժամանակ ծախսում: Դրա համար շատ ու երկար մտածիր, թե որ մոտիկ մարդկանցով ես ուզում քեզ շրջապատել: Ճիշտ կլնի կարծում եմ, որ շրջապատես մարդկանցով ովքեր քեզ հավատում են, ուրախանում են քո հաջողություններով, հասկանում, լսում և ոգևորում են:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ուրիշներին դատելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Արագ մի դատիր մարդկանց քանի որ չգիտես իրանց պատմությունը:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ծայրահեղական լինելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Մի եղիր ծայահեղական ոչ մի ասպարեզում: Իրոք, ամեն ինչ չափի մեջ է գեղեցիկ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Լսելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Սովորիր լսել մարդկանց ու չընդհատել: Մարդիկ անչափ գնահատում են նրանց ովքեր իրենց լսում են: Իզուր չեն ասում, որ մենք ունենք մեկ բերան ու երկու ականջ, որ շատ լսենք ու քիչ խոսանք:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Փողի մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Փողի բացակայությունը կարող է քեզ դժբախտացնել բայց ներկայությունը ամենևին երջանկության բանալին չէ: Փողը նախատեսված է փողային խնդիրներ լուծելու համար ու ոչ ավել: Կարծում եմ, որ կա փող ունելու ինչ-որ չափ որն անցնելուց հետո քո երջանկության աստիճանը գրեթե չի փոխվում: Ես օրինակ նախընտրում եմ փող ծախսել էն ամենի վրա ինչն ինձ երջանկացնում է, ճանապարհորդել, ընկերների հետ ժամանակ ծախսել, ժամանակ խնայել և այլն:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Առողջ ապրելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ամեն ինչ սկսվում է առողջ ապրելուց: Շատ հաճախ տեսնում եմ մարդիկ առողջ ապրելն ասոսցացնում են միայն սիրուն կամ նիհար լինելու մեջ, բայց կարծում եմ, որ քո ինքնազգացողությունը պետքա է ավելի առաջնային լինի քան քո տեսքը: Առողջ սնվիր, մարզվիր և դա քեզ կօգնի ամեն տեղ թե քո գործում, թե քո առօրիայում: Ինչպես մեքենայի շարժիչն է լավ աշխատում մաքուր վառելիքով այնպես էլ քո միտքն է սուր դառնում մաքուր մարմնում:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Զբաղվիր սպորտով, ցանկալի է ֆուտբոլով: :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Գրելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ես անչափ սիրում եմ գրել: Ցավոք շատ քիչ եմ գրում հայերեն ու արդեն երկար ժամանակ է հայերեն չեմ գրել (ինչպես տեսնում եք), բայց չեմ դադարել մտածել հայերենով: Գրելն օգնում  է մտածել ու երևի թե ամենակարճ արահետն է ինքնաբացահայտման: Ու՞զում ես ինքդ քեզ ավելի լավ ճանաչել ուրեմն սկսիր գրել: Գրիր ինչ-որ բաների մասին, որ քեզ հետաքրքրում է ու քո մտքերը սնդիկի պես կգնան տեղեր որտեղ երբեք չես եղել: Երևակայությունդ կընդլայնվի ու դու քեզ դրանից շատ ավելի լավ ու ազատ կզգաս:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Հաջողակ լինելու մասին&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Հաջողակ լինելու համար նախ պետք է ինքդ քեզ հարցնես, թե ինչ տեսք ունի հաջողությունը քեզ համար: Պետք է նախ տալ հաջողության սահմանումը հետո ընկնել դրա հետևից: Եթե արդեն մտածել ես դրա մասին ուրեմն մի քանի քայլ առաջ ես մնացածից:&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[2018 In Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[Seeing others sharing their 2018 year in the review made me want to write my own summary of 2018.

&lt;p&gt;Seeing others sharing their 2018 year in the review made me want to write my own summary of 2018. It&apos;s always interesting to look back and reflect on the past year. It&apos;s also a good opportunity to document the things you&apos;ve accomplished throughout the year and set some loose goals for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my personal life, there haven’t been any drastic changes. I still live in Jersey City, NJ and work remotely mostly from home and co-working spaces in New York. Because of that flexibility, Ani (my wife) and I were able to travel this year while working. We traveled to Canada (Toronto), Mexico (Cancun), Indonesia (Bali) and Singapore. We spent a month in our homeland Armenia. It’s always fun to spend time with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was the year when I started to actively pay attention to my health. I started doing weight training every weekday and closely watch my diet. I read and learned quite a lot about nutrition and weight lifting. For the past year, I’ve been following ”&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bigger-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate-ebook/dp/B006XF5BTG&quot;&gt;Bigger Leaner Stronger&lt;/a&gt;” book program and it’s the best bodybuilding book I read. It helped me to become a healthy person by teaching me some of the fundamentals of food dieting and weightlifting. I started to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strong.app/&quot;&gt;Strong app&lt;/a&gt; for tracking all my workouts. It’s the only workout app that really stuck with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to weightlifting, I also played soccer quite a lot. I played in 4-5 soccer leagues (outdoor turf and indoor) this year and made some good friends who I’m still in touch with. Group sports are really awesome and I love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got into writing. Writing is magical and in a way, it’s a meditation for me when I collect all my thoughts and direct them to a single purpose - writing down my thoughts. It really shaped me as a person and expanded my professional network. I wrote around 10 long articles from which ”&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer/&quot;&gt;Reflections on being a remote developer&lt;/a&gt;” had the most positive response from my readers. I plan to write more next year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/analyze&quot;&gt;Buffer Analyze&lt;/a&gt; this year with an incredible group of people. It’s still an early product but has a huge potential. It does feel like working in an early-stage startup where every decision we make has a huge impact. Being a product engineer really helped me to shape my product mindset and think about different aspects of a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got promoted to a Senior Engineer at Buffer. I’m very grateful to my teammates and manager for helping me to hit this milestone. It’s a big responsibility but I’m excited more. I wrote an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://tigranhakobyan.com/choosing-what-to-work-on-is-hard/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about how your work evolves over time as you grow into a senior engineering position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest accomplishment for me this year was discovering my true professional passion - developer productivity. I just love helping developers to be more productive. I can think of different ways of achieving this goal. The one that I’m more focused on right now is building great tools for developers. I’m really excited to explore how much my passion fits in my current work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cronhub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I started a new online &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io/&quot;&gt;side-business&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cronhub&quot;&gt;launched Cronhub&lt;/a&gt; on March 20, 2018, and it’s been a crazy ride full of learnings and challenges. I’m so happy I get to work on a product that I built from scratch. Cronhub is the first product that I created for developers. Currently, it has around 1500 registered users and 34 paying customers. Here is a screenshot from my Stripe account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The growth is slow but It doesn&apos;t discourage me. I&apos;m excited about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve always been very open with Cronhub numbers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/index/&quot;&gt;shared articles&lt;/a&gt; with my learnings. With Cronhub I learned a lot about growing a business, marketing, and product. It gave me a multidisciplinary skill set. I&apos;m also thankful to all the people who supported and encouraged me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Plans for 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t have strict goals or resolutions for the next year. However, there are a couple of things I hope to do next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to travel more with my wife. We already have a rough idea where we want to visit next year but nothing set on stone yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write more. Mainly I want to write more technical content for developers. I&apos;m very passionate about developer tools, systems, and micro-services so I&apos;ll probably write on these topics. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=66a44d40836bd23562f063269&amp;amp;id=e2c8a9a441&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to my mailing list if you don&apos;t want to miss my future writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a big one for me. I do want to get into public speaking. It&apos;s scary but I&apos;m willing to eradicate my fears and speak at a conference. I already signed up for Toastmasters so that&apos;s a good first step, isn&apos;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to continue working on Cronhub and accelerate the growth by finding more growth channels. I want to improve the product and find a product market fit. I&apos;ll definitely continue sharing my journey with anyone who is interested in building an online software business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:separator --&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:separator --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_68 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; id=&quot;68&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;68&quot;&gt;think&lt;/g&gt; that&apos;s all. Overall I think it&apos;s been a great year personally and professionally. I can&apos;t complain. I&apos;m excited for 2019. Happy New Year 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

This really encouraged me to write down my thoughts here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in your engineering career when you just get started you build things that others tell you to. It feels quite natural because that’s exactly what you had prior at school. You did homework and worked on the projects were are assigned by your professors. No one expects you to come up with project ideas but rather they expect you to successfully finish the work in a given deadline. The same way when you start a full-time job as a new grad engineer you’re hired to build and ship features that are prioritized by your managers. This is great because measuring your success and productivity is directly proportional to how much things you get done in a certain timeline. You know exactly what to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when you grow as an engineer and become somewhat a senior engineer figuring out what to work on gets a lot harder. No one assigns your projects anymore and you’re suddenly in a position where you should come up with your own ideas. Lacking the past experience of this kind of work really hits you hard and you start worrying and questioning your position at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can’t apply the same metrics to measure your success anymore because the type of work you do now is a lot different. You come up with ideas that your team should work on and you set the direction of the team. Now your work affects not only you but other engineers, designers, and the whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot more responsibility and it’s okay to feel a bit scared. I think every engineer has gone through this phase. I personally had so many terrible ideas that may seem like a waste of time now. However, admitting yourself that some of your ideas might turn into bad ideas is actually a good idea because failed ideas help you to develop the intuition you need to improve your failure rate. Over time you get better and you start recognizing which ideas tend to work and which ones don’t. Being patient and actively reflecting on your past experience is a key for engineering growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coming up with many terrible ideas in the past and reflecting on them I started to notice a pattern of most successful ideas. As a senior engineer, your ultimate goal is to maximize the impact of your work within the organization. Apart from writing code and doing code reviews, I have a couple of ideas that I think might be good guidelines to figure out what to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really think about whether your project is aligned with business priorities. Any time you come up with a new idea this is the first question you should be asking. If you’ve already started the project then it’s important to realize if your project isn’t going well. If that’s the case then make sure to communicate with your managers/engineers. Communicating as early as possible will help to smooth things out a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actively mentor other developers. Mentoring other engineers and helping them when they get stuck is part of a senior engineer’s job. Regularly explore and find out ways to mentor other developers. It’s like trying to scale yourself in the organization so others can also grow into a senior role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on projects that improve developer productivity. Developer productivity is incredibly important. If you can build a new project that improves developer productivity even with a very small margin then on the company level that sum converts into a big deal. If you’re building a CI/CD pipeline for your internal team then think about how you can scale it to other teams as well. Is there anything you can tweak in your project that would make it work for other teams too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build things that enable others to have a bigger impact. If developers are struggling with the local dev environment because it’s too slow then invest in building a better developer environment. With this, your work will have a business impact because it directly improves the velocity of the product engineering teams and helps them to move and deliver value faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these are only some ideas and I don’t expect these work in all organizations. As I’m still learning I expect that some of my ideas may end up being bad ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing what to work on is hard.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflections on building a side-business]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the past year or so I’ve started to value my time a lot and decided if I ever get involved in side-projects it won’t be for free.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Spent a week in Wells, VT to disconnect from work and reflect on all the things!.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Tigran and by definition, I’m probably a half-indie hacker. Why half you may ask? Because I’m a full-time software engineer at Buffer but at the same time I’m building an online profitable side-business called &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io/&quot;&gt;Cronhub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think how one of my favorite Internet sites, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiehackers.com/&quot;&gt;Indie Hackers&lt;/a&gt; defines it, I think I fit into that definition but not quite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;How IndieHackers.com defines indie hacker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generate money independently through the product I’ve created but also have a primary source of income which is my employer. I’m a solo founder and have been bootstrapping Cronhub for the past 8 months or so. As you see I may have the rights to call myself an indie hacker, right? If your answer is yes then let’s read my story further. Also, I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer/&quot;&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; if you like to read more about how I work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be an indie hacker for multiple reasons but the biggest motivation has always been my passion for building products. In the past, I’ve built other &lt;a href=&quot;http://tigranhakobyan.com/projects&quot;&gt;side-projects&lt;/a&gt; that were free. I even created a side-project when I was studying at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) called Wheelie. It became the official ride-sharing online platform for RIT students. However, I’ve shut it down two years ago due losing my interest for the product as well as worrying too much about safety issues. So yes, I love side-projects because it’s fun and you get to learn a wide range of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why I started Cronhub is financial income. I understand that money doesn’t necessarily buy happiness but it can buy freedom and I think it’s a big deal at least for me. Not having enough money is always very stressful and making money is usually more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so I’ve started to value my time a lot and decided if I ever get involved in side-projects it won’t be for free. Having a full-time job and a family doesn’t give you too much free time so I better justify what I spend my time on. This thinking really changed my perspective on things that I was keen to work on. This article is a reflection of that journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The motivation behind this article&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for writing this article is primarily based on wanting to share my knowledge and experience with others who are thinking of becoming an indie hacker. When I started this journey I always enjoyed reading other people’s stories, how they came up with an idea, how they ran their businesses and what it was like being an indie hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal formula that one can share for building a successful business. Even the word “successful” has a different meaning for different people. One may define success by revenue and others care about other metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, my goal is not to give any advice but rather openly share everything I’ve learned and experienced throughout this year so you can make your own conclusions. I also want to encourage other indie hackers to write about their stories because having more data points only helps people who want to get started with building their own products and making money independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has become the most innovative medium to meet like-minded people, read stories and get inspired by them. Inspiration and motivation are two great forces that fuel your mind to achieve your goals and dreams. So I hope I can motivate you even a little bit with this article. If I do, then my time writing this article is fully justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Launch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting my own business and having side-income has been on my mind for a long time. Since I changed my perspective about side-projects I knew that if I was going to dedicate my time to building something it wouldn’t be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting paid for my own products was never about quitting my full-time job. I know many indie hackers whose main motivation is to become independent and not work for anyone. I can see that view and respect it. However, I enjoy my current job at Buffer and have no plans to leave it anytime soon. Will I ever work for myself full-time? I don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up with an idea that can turn into a business wasn’t as hard as I imagined. I had a couple of requirements which I used to run my ideas over for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each idea I asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this the idea for the market I’m familiar with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this product solving my own problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I charge for this product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this something I’m passionate about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end only two ideas made it to the last step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An online course on how to build a SaaS product with Laravel and Vue.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An easy Cron monitoring tool for developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up choosing the second option above only because I knew it would take me less time to launch the MVP compared to making an online course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never done any online course before so I knew it would take quite a lot of time to finish it. I told myself I was going to give this idea a try and if it didn’t work out then I was going to step back and focus only on creating educational materials for developers. I knew there would always be a demand for those type of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cron monitoring has always been very tricky and challenging. At Buffer I deal with many cron jobs and need to make sure they run on time and if they fail I want to be aware of it. Before Buffer when I was at YCharts I created a custom dashboard for the team to track all internal scheduled jobs. The dashboard would contain the list of the scheduled jobs and some logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the way we would know whether the jobs ran or not was by looking at the internal dashboard. This meant that we had to check the dashboard every single day to make sure all the checks have passed. This wasn’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I talked to other developers I realized that this pattern repeats in many engineering teams. So this was a big signal for me of an existing problem. So I decided to build a product that makes it a breeze to monitor Cron jobs. If I could build it, I could use it for my side-projects and Buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working on the first version of the product for almost 2 months (part-time) I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cronhub&quot;&gt;launched Cronhub on Product Hunt on March 20, 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The reaction of the PH community was quite positive and this set the beginning of my indie hacker journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Cronhub’s listing on ProductHunt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launching a new product is a great milestone to hit but what comes after that is probably what most people struggle with. Growing your product and finding a product-market fit is a big challenge especially for first time founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growing and attracting users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to grow a business on the side comes with many challenges. Obviously, time is the biggest constraint but figuring out what to work on is another one that most founders face. Early on when you don’t have many users or customers it’s really hard to rely on data and make data-driven decisions. So the only option left is either seek advice from other founders or follow your own intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the product based decisions early on were based on my own intuition. Since I was building Cronhub for myself I knew exactly the features I needed to focus on. Being your own user is a big advantage and I strongly believe the idea of solving your own problem is really on point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After launching your own product, you usually end up doing two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterating on the product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling your product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most developers I know including myself are good at iteration but kind of suck at selling and marketing. I had no knowledge of sales so I focused on marketing instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided the way I was going to attract users and acquire customers is content marketing. Not only do I enjoy writing but I also knew that it had great long-term SEO benefits. It helps to grow your audience and get more exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After following all the basic SEO guides and publishing articles I was able to bring Cronhub to the first page of Google under certain keywords such as “cron monitoring”. It jumped from the 6th page to the second search result within months after me sharing articles on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking Cronhub’s Google Analytics data for November 2018, organic search was the biggest acquisition channel. So I think writing really pays off if you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Jumped to the first page for certain keywords!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, content marketing is very time-consuming so it’s hard and sometimes not sustainable for a solo founder. Making it your primary marketing channel requires you to dedicate a ton of time on writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think about different distribution channels that could work for Cronhub. One of them is Github marketplace which I’m currently working on. With this, I hope I can get more exposure to developers. I will share my experience after launching Cronhub on Github Marketplace in a different article so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, growth has been slow but partially meeting my own expectations, if I take into account the time I spend on Cronhub. November has been the highest revenue month when I hit around $620 in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to speed up growth and increase revenue but I think that requires changing my strategy. First, I need to understand who my ideal customer is and If I’m targeting developer teams then I should narrow it down further. It will help me to create a plan to bring more relevant users to Cronhub and increase the conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from bringing more leads to the site, I want to improve the onboarding process for new users. New users should be able to easily integrate their system jobs with Cronhub monitors. I usually have around 7 - 10 signups every day but only 2 - 3 of them actually activate monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to increase the activation, I want to eliminate the manual work it requires. For this purpose, I’m building a new CLI tool that developers can run on their servers to easily hook up their cron jobs with Cronhub monitors. I’m very excited about this tool and can’t wait to release the first version next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another small addition that helped me increase the number of sign-ups was supporting Github authentication. It took me less than a day to get it done but as of now almost half of my new users choose to sign up with Github. It’s a different concern whether those users have a higher conversion rate or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing articles like this is really a great way to reflect on your past journey. I feel like writing in a way is a meditation where you try to control your thoughts and direct them into a single purpose - writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I’ll try to write down everything that comes to my mind, everything that is worth sharing with you. These reflections are solely based on my experience of building a side-business while working full-time. The reason why I emphasize this is because it can be very different from someone who is working full-time on their own project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I meet new people in person or online and tell them about my side-project they keep asking me about how I manage to find time to work on anything else other than my job. My answer has been the same for the past year. I spend very little time but do it every day. It can be an hour or two hours but no more than that. After doing the same work every day it gets easier over time and it becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I know I have only 1 - 2 hours every day to work on Cronhub I get very strict about things I should work on. I usually break down my tasks so that I can finish them in a day. I know if it goes beyond a day or two I’m going to abandon it. It’s tough but it happens to me every single time. I keep my tasks small and that helps me get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some days when I feel down and just want to watch Netflix. I believe this happens to everyone and I noticed there is a pattern in my case. When I don’t get new customers for 2 weeks or so I lose my motivation because I think growth has stopped. When this happens I try to encourage myself to have the patience or sometimes open a new Dropbox Paper and write down some ideas that can help me accelerate the growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss having a co-founder sometimes. I need someone to bounce my ideas off or ask for advice. It also helps with motivation. When you share your concerns with someone who really cares and gets the context it helps because when you share you suddenly feel a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I ever try to find a co-founder for Cronhub? Maybe. I thought about this a lot and obviously, I don’t want a co-founder just for helping me feel better. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to fully define that role before I start actively looking for one. I also need to understand the trade-offs of having a co-founder versus staying solo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer support and pricing is something I wonder a lot about as well. How one affects another? I think it does in some way. If I’m considering running my business alone for a long time I need to define the type of customers I want to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can have many low-touch customers or few high-touch customers. I don’t want to spend too much time on customer support because I won’t have time left for product work. I think it’s better for me to focus on high-touch customers and focus on serving teams. On the other hand, targeting high-touch businesses suggests that I should start working on sales and it really scares me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product-market fit always gets me. How does one define finding a product-market fit? Or how do you know if you found one? I &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; about these topics a lot but it’s still unclear for me how you apply the theory in practice. One signal that maybe tells me that I have yet to find a product-market fit is slow growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I want to keep working on the product, make it better and only then hit the growth pedal. I’d like to learn more about the symptoms that people look for when thinking about product-market fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on Cronhub for the past year I discovered my strong passion for helping developers. I realized how much I love and enjoy building tools for developers. Improving developer productivity even with a small margin is a big deal and has a strong business value if you look at it on the company level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even 5% developer productivity increase can play a huge role in any company and directly impact the value that business delivers. This realization helped me to shape my professional vision - I want to help developers be more productive. I’m currently defining the “How” part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a great report, The Developer Coefficient by Stripe that conducted a study with thousands of C-level executives and developers across 30+ industries. One of the survey questions was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of a priority is it for upper management to increase the productivity of its developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the answer was 96%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started to think about the environment where I could maximize my impact on developers. How can I have a bigger impact? It’s really hard to answer but I’ve been thinking about this for a while now. I can work for myself in the long run by becoming an entrepreneur or have an employer where I can build a career. Right now, I have taken the hybrid approach where I do both but I’m curious to see how this evolves over time. Maybe it’s a story for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. If you’re a developer who is using cron jobs or any scheduled tasks then try &lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io&quot;&gt;Cronhub&lt;/a&gt;. It’d mean a lot to me if you could share the word. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the winter of 2016 when I opened my phone and saw the job offer from Buffer. I remember I was in an Uber with my wife driving back home from the JFK airport. So many things have changed since then. I grew as a person and as an engineer. This article is a story where I openly share all my learnings and challenges I’ve experienced throughout my journey of working remotely as a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Tigran and I’m a software engineer at Buffer. I’m also the creator of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cronhub.io&quot;&gt;Cronhub&lt;/a&gt;, a tool to help developers to monitor
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling&quot; id=&quot;16&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;16&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/g&gt; jobs. In the past, I’ve created other &lt;a href=&quot;https://tigranhakobyan.com/projects&quot;&gt;other side-projects&lt;/a&gt; as well and written &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/index/&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; about my journey of building a side-project while having a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of questions on Twitter about my experience at Buffer and how it feels to work remotely. Most of the questions are about time management, work and day structure and the tools that I use daily to stay productive. Even though these are very good questions I’ve decided to step back a little bit and share my story from the beginning when and how I started my remote work. I hope to share all the good and challenging parts of my experience. I know remote work culture is rapidly growing across the world so I hope this will be a useful resource for beginners who’re considering to be remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest to tell you that I also wanted to write this blog post for myself to look back and reflect back. That’s why it may feel like I’m writing in my diary. I hope you don’t mind that style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting a remote job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that I never thought about getting a remote job. It kind of didn’t matter at the time I was applying for new jobs in February 2016. I was living in Jersey City, NJ which is very close to Manhattan and I knew if I had a job in New York City the commute wouldn’t be an issue (especially with audiobooks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at the time the top company on my list that I wanted to work for was Buffer which was and still is a fully remote company with employees spread across the world. I heard about and used Buffer before joining the team and read so much about their culture. I also really admired Joel Gascoigne (the founder of Buffer) and enjoyed reading his Buffer story and all the learnings he was sharing on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied for a backend engineer position at Buffer. Lucky for me this position was open at the time and it really matched my previous background working with backend technologies and services. I knew that Buffer had many applicants for the same position (if I’m not mistaken we had around 1500 applications for this position) so my hope was quite small. Only after couple weeks of me applying I received an email from Leo (the co-founder of Buffer who’s not with the company anymore) offering to chat. He wrote that he really liked my background and wanted to get to know me better in a call. I was beyond happy and excited for the opportunity and was really surprised because quite frankly I wasn’t expecting to hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my chat with Leo
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_12 gr-alert sel gr_gramm gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; id=&quot;12&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;12&quot;&gt;,&lt;/g&gt; I started the interview process. Buffer makes sure that whoever joins the team is a great fit so apart from technical the interviews were also focused on the culture. &amp;nbsp;When I joined Buffer, I had to go through a 45-days long boot camp. Boot camp is like a date where both of you take your time to figure out whether you’re a good fit for each other. While in a boot camp you’re considered a contractor until you become a full-time employee. Currently, we don’t have boot camp anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I wasn’t necessarily looking for remote opportunities. It just so happened that I’ve become a remote worker because I really wanted to work at Buffer and I was excited to explore what remote work would offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial challenges of working remotely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is very different from working in the office and I don’t think you fully grasp the difference until you actually start being remote. For someone like me who never worked in a remote environment the beginning wasn’t smooth and it came with challenges. Eventually, I got better at most of those things but it’s worth looking back now and reflect on my early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can clearly remember my very first day at Buffer. I woke up, had a breakfast and coffee then started my day with this question: &amp;nbsp;“So what’s now, what should I do?”. It was a valid question, really. &amp;nbsp;There wasn’t any office that I had to go to and the way how I used to associate the start of my working day was the office. I felt confused and lonely for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the office based environment, we rely so much on in-person communication that it feels really odd not to have that commodity anymore. The remote environment is the complete opposite because it’s primarily based on asynchronous communication. Actually, current remote workspaces are more of the combination of both synchronous and asynchronous communication and each one completes another. There are some tasks when synchronous communication is more time effective and later on you start learning when and what type of communication is better. Communication is still a big issue in remote teams but I think at Buffer we have found the good balance over the last years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to my initial challenges, the biggest one I was facing was confusion over how the work is done and structured. When I joined Buffer I got assigned role and cultural buddies who were there for me to support me throughout my boot camp. Having them by my side was a huge help. I used every opportunity to ask questions and it helped me a lot understand the work process. In the beginning, I was mostly working from home in order to manage my time more efficiently plus I was nervous
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_32 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; id=&quot;32&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;32&quot;&gt;of&lt;/g&gt; having video calls in coffee shops because of the noise and poor wifi signal. Wifi speed has become such a big part of my flow that I’ve bookmarked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fast.com&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt; (a network speed measuring tool developed by Netflix) webpage on my browser and moved it to the right beginning of all bookmarks for easy access. Working from home really worked out for me in the beginning because I got a lot of things done with zero distractions but then eventually it made me feel more isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge I was facing, in the beginning, was not being able to switch myself off from the work and constantly being online. I’d end up starting my day at 8am and signing off around 8-9pm. It didn’t last long but obviously working long hours was a problem. You have to be very strict with your working hours otherwise mental exhaustion can easily take over. You don’t want that. You want to set your working hours and stick to them. Of course, you can be flexible when and how you work depending on your lifestyle but time management is key. Think about what time of the day you’re most productive and construct your day accordingly. For instance, I’m a morning person so I do the most important tasks first thing in the morning. With no destruction and 2-3 hours focus work, I can get a lot of things done. I try to schedule my calls in the afternoon when my mental energy is not too high but I can still concentrate and focus on the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue talking about my work routine a bit later. In the meantime, let’s talk about how I’ve become better at remote work after my initial challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting better at remote work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first couple of months of working remotely were the most challenging for me. Working at Buffer was great and I think because I worked for Buffer I’ve found a way to overcome these challenges. With the help and advice of my teammates and the learnings from my experience over time, I felt I’ve become better at working remote. I felt I was more productive and found my place. Now when I look back I think there were a couple things that really contributed to that success and realization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two months after joining Buffer my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/djfarrelly&quot;&gt;Dan Farrelly&lt;/a&gt; and I decided to find a co-working space in NYC where both of us could commute a few times a week. I was super pumped and lucky to have a co-worker based in the same area as I was. Dan, who is now the director of engineering at Buffer, has become my best pal whose advice and help really shaped me as a developer and remote worker. &amp;nbsp;I found a friend and co-worker who also worked remotely and had enough context in the remote environment to understand my challenges. We started to co-work couple times a week, have lunch together and discuss a variety of topics including our work at Buffer. As of now, we co-work 2-3 times a week in New York City and the rest of the week we work from home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding someone who you can work with is a great way to stay social. One of the other things that I’ve tried and it was very useful was attending meetups in NYC on the topics that interested me. I met like-minded people who I could find common things to connect about. Online communities can be helpful too and there are many remote work-based communities you can be part of.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started to better manage my time. Every day I dedicated time to prioritize my next day’s tasks by setting specific goals. I usually set 3-4 tasks for a day because I usually don’t go beyond that number. Prioritization really helped me with time management and it also made me more focused on things that mattered. The tricky part of remote work is that you fully control your time and you have to be very cautious how and what you spend your time on. Of course, distractions can happen but finding ways to improve your focus is such a key element of a productive remote work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use Slack at Buffer and I heard about Slack in the past and knew it was very popular among tech companies. I think it is a great tool and it has many benefits for the workplace including bringing the team together. However, it’s focused on synchronous communication. For some remote teams like Buffer asynchronous communication is very important and it has become part of our DNA and culture. We are very mindful of our teammates’ time so we want to structure our communication in a way that at least some portion of it can be handled asynchronously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another reason why we are inclined to communicate asynchronously is the time zone difference between our teammates. We are spread all around the world and it’s not always possible to jump on a call or get an immediate answer to your direct messages.
		&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_28 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep&quot; id=&quot;28&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;28&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/g&gt; is also very supportive of each team member’s lifestyle and we respect the working hours of everyone on the team. Prioritizing my time better helped me to get better at async communication. I’ve started to rely more on tools that enable asynchronous communication like email or Dropbox Paper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started to pay attention to mental health as a top priority. I work better when I’m less stressed. I’m lucky that Buffer is an amazing place that supports mental health for every bit of it. I started to work out in the mornings, play soccer and track my working hours which drastically improved my mood and motivation. I stopped working late hours and tried to get a good 8 hours sleep every night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I finally started to take advantage of my remote work lifestyle. I started to travel more, going to Buffer retreats and visiting my family in Armenia for month long trips. It’s really incredible to have the flexibility to spend a month with my family and friends in Armenia. Being able to work from anywhere I think it’s the most awesome advantage of remote work. Since the beginning of the year, I’ve traveled to Canada, Mexico, Bali, Singapore and flying to Armenia in a month. We are planning to visit more destinations in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My typical workday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have people asking me this question a lot on Twitter so I’ve decided to dedicate a separate section to write about what my typical workday looks like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up at 7:05am every day. I have an alarm setup but rarely need it. My body has its own alarm that is quite precise. I wake up and the first thing I do is making my morning coffee and have it with the pre-workout meal. In the summers, I’m usually having an espresso with an ice cube which makes the coffee more refreshing. At 8:10am I’m at the gym to work out. I’ve been doing weight exercises for a year now by strictly trying to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bigger-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate-ebook/dp/B006XF5BTG&quot;&gt;Bigger Leaner Stronger: The Simple Science of Building the Ultimate Male Body&lt;/a&gt; program to gain muscle and lose fat. It’s been working out great for me and I see the difference in my body and general health. I highly recommend this book if you’re unsure what workout program you should follow. It’s a great book for beginners in particular. &amp;nbsp;I’m tracking my workouts using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strong.app&quot;&gt;Strong&lt;/a&gt; and very recently hit my 100th workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend an hour in the gym and right after it, I try to have my protein-rich breakfast. Usually, it consists of eggs, cottage cheese and a piece of whole wheat bread. After my breakfast, I’m getting ready to start my working day. I usually ping Dan to decide where we want to work from that day. We use Croissant to find and book a co-working space. It’s a great app and has many spaces available in New York City. We usually stick to the ones in the Financial District because it’s relatively close to both of us. It takes 12-15 minutes door to door for me to get there. I’m in the co-working space around 10-10:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m done with work around 6:30pm on a typical day. Couple times a week I have evening soccer games so if that’s the case I try to be home a bit early to have a light dinner before my game. Playing soccer is probably my most favorite activity in the universe. I’m a huge soccer fan although my wife doesn’t really like the idea of me paying $140 for authentic soccer jerseys. However, last year she surprised me by arranging a meeting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mkhitaryan.am/&quot;&gt;Henrik Mkhitaryan&lt;/a&gt; in London who is my favorite player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I’m mentally very tired I spend most of my evenings working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cronhub.io&quot;&gt;Cronhub&lt;/a&gt; and trying to grow it. I’ve written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/index/&quot;&gt;couple blog posts&lt;/a&gt; in the past about Cronhub and how I’m trying to make it into an online business. I’m very lucky that my wife is very supportive of this and she is rooting for me. I’m a big believer of side-income and that’s why I try to spend at least 2 hours every day to work on my side-project. If I’m very tired I just crush on the couch and watch a Netflix show with my wife. In the weekends I’m mostly trying to rest and do something with my wife and friends. There are weekends where I work on Cronhub but not that often. I know how critical the rest is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What tools we use and rely on plays a huge role in our productivity and work life. At Buffer we are generally open-minded to experiment with different tools that we think could benefit the team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the tools that we use daily at Buffer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/&quot;&gt;G Suite&lt;/a&gt; - From the G Suite family we use Gmail and Google Calendar. We use emails a lot and that’s why I have auto filtering and labeling setup so I can easily go over my inbox. Setting up filters and labels is not that fun but it’s worth investing your time just once and forget about it later on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; - We use Slack for sync communication and direct messages. We have a general channel, engineering, etc. I like Slack and I think there are situations when it’s hugely beneficial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; - We use Zoom for video calls. We are so dependent on Zoom and it’s such a great tool to bring the entire team together. It handles quite well the calls with many team members which happens in our all hands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://paper.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox Paper&lt;/a&gt; - Probably one of my most favorite tools. Even now I’m using it to write the draft of this blog post. We use Paper for collaboration and note-taking. It’s a big part of our asynchronous communication.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discourse.com&quot;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt; - We use discourse for announcements, promotions or sharing general learnings in the team. I enjoy using discourse and I find it very intuitive to navigate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from these tools I have my own tools that help me to be more productive. I’m a happy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.todoist.com&quot;&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; user where I log all my daily tasks and check them when they’re done. I track my working hours with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rescuetime.com/&quot;&gt;Rescue Time&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great tool that helps me to understand how I spend the most of my time and where. It also monitors the use of social media that I’m actively trying to reduce. In a remote team, you usually end up creating and sharing screenshots or screencasts to show something to your teammates. We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getcloudapp.com/&quot;&gt;CloudApp&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose and it’s so worth it. Highly recommend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding a remote job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for your first remote job then this short section will probably be useful for you. Remote work is quite trendy nowadays and many companies introduce remote work as an option for their employees. You can either work in a fully-remote company or a company that has an office but has also remote teammates. There are also the freelancers who can be considered as remote workers too but it’s a bit different I think. &amp;nbsp;My experience is only based on working in a fully-remote company that has no office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re non-remote right now but considering to switch to remote so you can travel or spend mo
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; id=&quot;18&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;18&quot;&gt;re tim&lt;/g&gt;e with your family then the good news is, it’s getting easier to find remote opportunities because the field is growing and companies are starting to realize the benefits of going remote. Remote companies have the big advantage of hiring talented people from the large pool of candidates because the location is not important anymore. I know a couple of companies apart from Buffer that is fully remote Automattic, GitLab, InVision, Doist, Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can always go to
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_8 gr-alert sel gr_gramm gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; id=&quot;8&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;the &lt;/g&gt;career pages of these companies and see if they have any open job opportunities. There is also another great resource you might consider. &amp;nbsp;The one that I like is
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://remotive.io/&quot;&gt;
		&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace&quot; id=&quot;9&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Remotive&lt;/g&gt;
	&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace&quot; id=&quot;10&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Remotive&lt;/g&gt; is a community that helps you to find a remote job. If you already have a remote job then you can connect with other remote workers, get tips or start a discussion on any topic. Another great website that is more focused on helping you to find a remote job is &lt;a href=&quot;https://remoteok.io/&quot;&gt;Remote OK&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote vs Non-remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Buffer and working in a fully remote company I worked for office-based companies. While I was doing my masters at RIT I interned at PTC for 7 months and 3 months at Twitter. After the school, I joined YCharts and stayed there for a year. I’ve experienced both working remotely and working in the office. I think both workspaces have tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a remote work you’re not tied to a location so you can potentially live in a cheap place and earn enough to have a good life. In fact, I have a couple of Twitter friends who’re currently living in Bali and working for a remote company or trying to start their own thing. Their expenses are quite low compared to mine who lives in a New York City area. &amp;nbsp;A couple of months ago when I was in a co-working space in Bali I saw many digital nomads living and working from Bali. Nomading feels like a movement now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work remotely you also have the option to choose your working hours. So if you have a family you can spend more time with them
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; id=&quot;15&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;15&quot;&gt;by&lt;/g&gt; work from home. However, you have to be a self-motivated person and eager to stay focused most of the time. Loneliness can be an issue too so finding different ways for you stay social can be helpful. Of course, it also depends on your personality
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_73 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep&quot; id=&quot;73&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;73&quot;&gt;.&lt;/g&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an office-based job, you’re tied to a specific location. You have to commute to your work which sometimes can take a lot of time. &amp;nbsp;I also think developing personal relationships with your co-workers is a bit easier in-person when you all are in the same space. At Buffer
	&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_8 gr-alert sel gr_gramm gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; id=&quot;8&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;,&lt;/g&gt; we have annual retreats where the entire team gets together for a week. It’s probably one of my favorite times of the year because I get to see my co-workers and spend time with them. It makes such a big difference because it brings us together and helps us to develop better relationships with our co-workers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, working remotely as a developer for almost 3 years has been an incredible journey for me. Years full of professional learning, travel, connections and new experiences. This reflection is solely based on my own experience of working at Buffer so it can differ from someone else working remotely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often get asked but I don’t have the answer yet whether I’ll ever go back to be non-remote. It’s hard for me to tell because it really depends on the opportunity. I like the lifestyle and freedom I have but it can change in the future. Right now, I’m focused on my work at Buffer and growing &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cronhub.io&quot;&gt;Cronhub&lt;/a&gt; as a side-business. My eventual goal is to become financially independent so I can spend my mental energy on things that I deeply care about. It has probably become the north star that guides me forward and gives motivation. I see the path that I can take to achieve that goal and I’m doing my best.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tigranhakobyan.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Tigran&lt;/a&gt;, I’m 29 and I’m the creator of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cronhub.io&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Cronhub&lt;/a&gt;.

Cronhub is a &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling&quot; id=&quot;21&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/g&gt; monitoring tool for developers. It monitors and alerts you if any of your scheduled jobs fail or run longer than expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the past, I’ve shared an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/@tigran/how-i-shipped-my-first-saas-side-project-while-working-full-time-42862e847b&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on how I launched Cronhub while working full-time and today I’m writing about a topic that I had been wondering about for a long time after the launch. Finding the first customers is probably the hardest challenge for every product maker in early stages. This explains why so many people are curious how others managed to find their first customers and read their stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this article, I want to share my story and experience of acquiring my first paid customers after launching my side-project. It’s been a fun and interesting journey full of joy and challenges. I hope I can shed some light on this process and inspire other developers to find their own path by reading my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working on Cronhub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a full-time job and trying to build an online business on the side is challenging. The biggest challenge is being very organized with your time and not burning yourself out. Apart from my full-time job at Buffer I usually work on Cronhub 1-2 hours on weekdays and maybe 5-6 hours on the weekends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to get 8-hours sleep each day otherwise I feel tired the next day which really hurts my productivity. &amp;nbsp;Of course, there are some days when I feel down but I know it’s just temporary and I have to wait for the fog to lift.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Cronhub is a side-business I pay a lot of attention to prioritize the tasks. I group all my tasks into two high-level buckets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list {&quot;ordered&quot;:true} --&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tasks that will improve the product and make customers happy (product work)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tasks that will bring more visitors by increasing the awareness of the site (marketing work)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the other aspect that improves the activation of the product like creating and activating a Cronhub monitor but I keep it in the product bucket just for the sake of simplicity. The challenge here is finding the sweet spot where you balance the two buckets. Being an engineer I’m naturally more inclined to prioritize more product work but I’m deliberately practicing to overcome this bias.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have 7-10 sign-ups daily. Most of the visitors come from my past blog post articles that are not necessarily my target audience. However, content marketing has been the only marketing channel that I’ve used with Cronhub. No cold emails or ads.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Here are some metrics that I thought could be interesting to share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:subhead --&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-subhead&quot;&gt;Product and Financial Metrics&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:subhead --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cronhub has around ~1100 signed up users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;450 active monitors making around 130,000 pings daily. A monitor is active if it has received at least one ping from an external job or script (e.g. your daily database backup job, weekly digest email job)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only in the last 3 weeks, Cronhub reported around 3000 &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling&quot; id=&quot;8&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/g&gt; job failures to our users. The failure can be either that job failed to run on schedule or ran longer than expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Net Revenue since &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cronhub&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;the launch day&lt;/a&gt; is $710 (actual total gross revenue minus any fees, refunds, disputes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trial conversion rate 83% (I expect this number will go down eventually)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monthly expenses, $57&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My expenses haven’t changed since the launch day and I plan to keep it as low as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something I didn’t expect at all is seeing almost half of my customers choosing the yearly billing plan over monthly. I don’t know if I should make some conclusions here but I may if I see this pattern repeats when I gain more customers and data points.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I’m very proud of but still plan to improve is Cronhub&apos;s SEO score. &amp;nbsp;It’s really cool to see a big chunk of my visitors coming from organic search especially for an early product like Cronhub. I think it’s a great validation for me to continue focusing on SEO and improving the organic growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from the basic SEO techniques (like keywords, fast page load, etc) and writing content on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Cronhub’s blog&lt;/a&gt; I haven’t done anything else. I’ll talk more about this a bit later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acquiring my first customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I launched Cronhub I could only dream about having 10 customers and now when I’m here it seems like I’ve so much yet to cover. Getting my first paid customer was very crucial for the product. I spent a couple of months building the MVP (minimal viable product) and I wanted to see the returns of my hard work. Also, I think having a product that people pay for is a great way to validate your idea and know that you’re onto something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was very lucky to get my first ever customer signing up for the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://cronhub.io/pricing&quot;&gt;Developer ($7)&lt;/a&gt;” plan the next day after the launch. At that time I only had one paid plan on Cronhub but getting the Stripe notification of having a new customer was something special. It immediately boosted my confidence and pushed my motivation to the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, this customer switched to the business plan because he and his team needed more monitors. However, when he emailed me the “Business” plan was still on “Coming soon” phase but I told him that I’d upgrade him within the next couple of days and I did. I made it my top priority and had him on the business plan next week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the business plan, I had to build team member support from scratch but it was worth it because I knew I had to support teams on Cronhub anyway. Cronhub is primarily built for developer teams so team invitation and management support was a&amp;nbsp;no-brainer. It was just a matter of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I manually upgraded the customer and offered a lifetime discount on the business plan. I’m always in touch with my first customer and he has been very helpful with providing valuable feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So my first customer came from the Product Hunt launch, however, it took me 2 weeks to get two more customers and both within the same week. After the launch obviously the number of visitors went down so I had to think about ways to promote Cronhub. I really didn’t think for too long here and decided to do what I enjoy the most, write.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love writing. I think of writing as a way of meditating. It helps me to stay focused on one thing which is not always possible with my monkey brain. I knew I could write about my experience of building Cronhub as an online business which I’ve been doing ever since.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writing helped me to grow my audience as well as market Cronhub. After starting to write I started to grow my Twitter follower as well. Below is the graph that illustrates the evolution of my Twitter followers after I started blogging regularly. I think you can see the breaking point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;align&quot;:&quot;wide&quot;} --&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image alignwide&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_463B5B843C808EC567696389CB0E09BF6A18243425A5174DFBB47067DD0D878A_1535238962842_Image+2018-08-25+at+7.15.14+PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;I started writing regularly in March and you can see how my audience grew ever since&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I decided to make content as my primary marketing channel I started a blog with a new subdomain &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io&quot;&gt;blog.cronhub.io&lt;/a&gt;. With the new blog, my intention was to squeeze all the SEO benefits. Since I wanted to improve the SEO score to get more organic visitors I dedicated a week or so to make Cronhub more SEO optimized. There are many resources covering the basics which you can find on the web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example of how my site optimization and content writing helped on the SEO side is this screenshot from Google Analytics showing that almost 40% of my traffic on August 23-24 came from organic search. This percentage fluctuates between 20% - 40% every day. I think it’s great and I have to keep the spirit high. It would be great to know what the industry average is for SaaS products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publish all my articles on Cronhub’s blog first and then I republish them on Medium and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com&quot;&gt;Indie Hackers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great that Indie Hackers allows setting a canonical URL for your articles which helps with SEO. One thing I do with my Medium articles is trying to get them published on popular publications such as &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great exposure and opportunity to get your voice heard by a large audience. I highly recommend to give it a try. Here is a quick gif showing my post stats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet__text&quot;&gt;One downside of content marketing is that &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace&quot; id=&quot;4&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;it’s&lt;/g&gt; very time consuming but it’s a long-term game. It’s like an investment you do now for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;wp-block-coblocks-click-to-tweet__twitter-btn&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/share?&amp;amp;text=One%20downside%20of%20content%20marketing%20is%20that%20%2C%5Bobject%20Object%5D%2C%20very%20time%20consuming%20but%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20long-term%20game.%20It%E2%80%99s%20like%20an%20investment%20you%20do%20now%20for%20a%20better%20future.&amp;amp;url=https://blog.cronhub.io/how-i-acquired-my-first-10-customers-for-cronhub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click to Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:coblocks/click-to-tweet --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hunch is that most of my current articles are read by many developers but the question is whether those developers are likely to show interest in &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_43 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace&quot; id=&quot;43&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;43&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/g&gt; jobs or not. As an example, If I had to write an article about&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; Kubernetes Cron Jobs&lt;/a&gt; and how they work I’d expect that most of my readers know at least what &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_45 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling&quot; id=&quot;45&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;45&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/g&gt; jobs are. I want to narrow down the scope of my articles and target to more relevant developers. What I care most is not the number of visitors but the type of visitors. I have a couple of ideas and excited to see how they perform in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After having three paying customers within the first month I was very pumped when I got my first yearly “Developer” plan customer in early May. It was around the time when I started to read and learn more about product pricing. I knew nothing about pricing but I was keen to learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I talked to product managers and people who understood SaaS pricing model better than I did (btw I wrote &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/how-i-priced-my-side-project/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;an entire article&lt;/a&gt; where I share all my learnings on pricing). Then, I changed my pricing table and added a new intermediate plan called “Startup”. It was in-between “Developer ($7)” and “Business ($49)” plans because I thought the pricing gap between these two plans were too high.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I changed the pricing and to my big surprise my next customer signed up for the yearly “Startup” plan. It felt really good. I felt like that soccer manager who brings a substitute player to the field and that player scores a goal.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then, I started to slowly acquire new customers until I got to the first sweet spot, 10 paying customers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, looking back it did take me almost 5 months until I got my first 10 customers. This is me being a solo founder working around 10-15 hours per week. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been a slow journey and, of course, there are times when you don’t have a single new customer in the span of multiple weeks and you feel terrible with lack of motivation. But I know these things will pass and I’m excited more than ever to get to my 100 customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I reflect on my past journey I can certainly say that there is no universal formula that one can use to succeed in this process. However, I believe that patience is the biggest player. You have to believe in yourself and be patient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I could make a list of my main learnings&amp;nbsp;it would be this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on the core product and user experience in the beginning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not spend too much time thinking about your pricing in your early days. Think of pricing as a feature that you can always iterate on. Start from the MVP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customer support is very important. Be a human&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_21 gr-alert sel gr_gramm gr_replaced gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; id=&quot;21&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;21&quot;&gt;, &lt;/g&gt;not a company. Be in touch with your customers and ask for feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decide what your primary marketing channel is and focus on it in the early days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Share all the cool things you’re working on with your audience. People are genuinely interested in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask for help and advice. People are generally nice and want you to succeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next goal is to go from 10 to 100 customers. Today I asked for advice on Twitter and Joel Gascoigne replied with a great one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk more to my customers and adjust my marketing strategy around the value that Cronhub provides to them. Apart from content marketing, I want to create more acquisition channels that have a higher activation rate. Finding a product market fit is my eventual goal. I hope I will get there soon.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As a side note, I’m very excited to share that Cronhub got accepted into YC&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupschool.org/&quot;&gt;Startup School&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Advisor track. It&apos;s a 10-week long online course where you get exposed to a mentor and a great community. I’m excited to apply all my learnings on Cronhub and share my experience with you! Stay tuned for a new blog article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had asked me a couple months ago if I could ever write an article about pricing, it probably would have made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until a few months&amp;nbsp;agao, I didn’t know anything about product pricing even though&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cronhub.io/my-first-saas-project/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I’d launched my first SaaS project&lt;/a&gt;. The way I priced my product was by solely relying on my own intuition, as well as looking at how other similar SaaS products priced their services. I think this is what most beginners do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why on earth write an article if I’m not an expert on pricing?&amp;nbsp;BecauseI’ve come to realize that it’s totally okay to write about topics you’re not expert on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Coyier’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/925081793576837120?lang=en&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;inspired me to start writing about things I wish I could find on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to use blogging as an excuse to learn a specific topic.&amp;nbsp;This article is the fruit of that inspiration, and I’m happy to share it with you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren’t many articles on the pricing of side-projects, even though the number of revenue-generating side-projects is growing. If you go to&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiehackers.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indie Hackers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;you can see many of them there,&amp;nbsp;and many makers in the community wonder and ask questions about pricing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I’ve summarized everything I’ve learned about side-project pricing. For the last two months or so, I’ve been reading about pricing and talking to people who are knowledgeable about pricing. It really helped me to understand the basics and create a&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;successful pricing model for an SaaS project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cronhub.io/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cronhub&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(my side-project) as an example to better explain my view and thinking process, because I believe it’s easier to digest new information using an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my learnings here apply to SaaS products, but I think&amp;nbsp;other types of businesses can benefit from them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5ecc&quot;&gt;Why monetizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetizing your project from day one is very important. You can think of the “monetization” as a feature that you want your product to have. This feature significantly increases your product’s chances of success.&amp;nbsp;Usually, you build features for your customers but this one is for you, to keep you more motivated to work on your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your motivation and persistence are the key drivers to move your project forward.&amp;nbsp;If you value something, it keeps your motivation high.&amp;nbsp;What’s the easiest way to know whether your project is valuable? Asking people to pay for it.&amp;nbsp;In my opinion, if you can find 10 people willing to pay for your project, you know you’ve got something that people are ready to pay for. After that, you can find the next 100, 1000, and even more.&amp;nbsp;Finding the first customers is the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because finding the first customers is hard, it’s important to set the right pricing model in the beginning.&amp;nbsp;Pricing is a living feature, and as any other feature, it requires multiple iterations until you get it right.&amp;nbsp;It’s totally okay to make mistakes in the beginning.&amp;nbsp;In fact, for Cronhub, I’m still not sure whether I’ve got it right or not. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’m open to changing it if that’s what’s best, and that’s what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your intention is to build a business from your side-project, then you should charge for your project. It’s hard and more often demotivating to work for free. You value your time and others should, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;aaa6&quot;&gt;Pricing strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’m not an expert in this field, I can’t give you very technical answers to pricing strategies. However, one thing I can do is to explain these strategies in a more human way with simple words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s even better for you? 🙂 Good. Let’s go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of a pricing strategy is to maximize your product’s revenue.According to a book that I’ve read, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.priceintelligently.com/developing-your-saas-pricing-strategy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The anatomy of SaaS pricing strategy&lt;/a&gt;” (which a great book btw), there are three pricing strategies for SaaS products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;966a&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Plus Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most basic pricing model you can think of, because it really makes sense. First, you&amp;nbsp;calculate everything that costs money for your project and then add a healthy margin on top of it. The margin is your profit, and it represents the value that you give to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take Cronhub as an example. Cronhub is a cron job (or any scheduled task) monitoring tool. Monitors cost me money, because they send emails and SMSs to my users. Sending emails and SMSs is costly for my business.&amp;nbsp;Having more monitors will increase my cost, and that’s why I priced Cronhub by the number of monitors. If you want more monitors, you should pay more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most first-time side-project builders take this approach, because it’s simple and it covers the costs.&amp;nbsp;The challenge with this pricing strategy is the unpredictability of the future. If your costs unexpectedly go up in the future your profit margin will drop and you will have to increase your prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;7084&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitor-Based Pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, this pricing strategy is influenced by your competitors. When you don’t know the initial value of your product, you usually turn to your competitors.&amp;nbsp;You check their pricing tables so you can come up with yours. Well, I’ve done it for Cronhub, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re launching a product in a new industry, it makes sense to check competitor pricing because you don’t want to go too high or too low. We’re always afraid of losing customers because of the big price difference from our competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pricing strategy is simple and less prone to be wrong. You can probably spend an hour or so researching competitors and come up with a pricing table that is similar to your competitors. This way your future customers won’t think that your product is too expensive or too cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one downside I see for this model is that you don’t want to be guided by your competitors from day one. You want your product to have its own personality, and it should be reflected in the pricing as well.&amp;nbsp;Use competitor pricing as an inspiration and benchmark, but not your guiding strategy. For me, I see this strategy mostly used in combination with other pricing models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;e815&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value-based pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy is also called customer-based strategy and is solely based on your customer surveys and research. You want to know how much your customers are willing to pay for your product, and the only way to do so is to go and talk to them. Most companies use in-product surveys to collect this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other benefits with this strategy, too. You get to know your customers and their needs, which helps you to build the best product. I think that by following this strategy, you’re most likely to come up with a better pricing table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this model can only be applied after some initial iterations when you have a decent customer base. That’s why&amp;nbsp;I believe that this model should be used as part of the last pricing iterations on your pricing table.&amp;nbsp;It doesn’t mean that you should not talk to your customers from early days. Just set a goal for yourself that you eventually want to use this strategy to decide your pricing table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to re-apply this strategy often, because your customer base and the market needs keep changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ebad&quot;&gt;Break down your customers into&amp;nbsp;groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that breaking down your user base into groups is not only important for building a better product, but also for modeling your pricing.When you start thinking about pricing, you naturally measure it with only one dimension using just a single variable (like I used only the monitor count as a pricing measure for Cronhub).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you want to add another dimension based on your customer groups. There is a term called “Pricing Axes”&amp;nbsp;which I first heard from&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Joel Gascoigne&lt;/a&gt;in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buffer.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our company&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;retreat this year in Singapore. These axes represent variables that you can use to better model your pricing. For instance, Cronhub has two pricing axes now after launching the team plan: the number of monitors and the team member count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking down my customers into groups helped me come up with the second axis for Cronhub. I have divided my potential customers into two groups, solo developers, and developer teams. It naturally makes sense that there should be different pricing for each of these groups, because their needs are different. Following this strategy, I’ve created two pricing plans for the team depending on the number of team members they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can add more axes along the way, and it depends on your product.&amp;nbsp;I think keeping your pricing axes around 2 - 3 makes sense at least in the beginning.&amp;nbsp;Adding&amp;nbsp;more variables may confuse your users, and you don’t want that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:3} --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2bc2&quot;&gt;Applying the strategies to&amp;nbsp;Cronhub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to also talk about how I’ve applied the above-mentioned pricing strategies for Cronhub and the pricing challenges I’ve faced when starting Cronhub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cronhub is a product for developers.&amp;nbsp;I knew that the developer market is not an easy one to be in, but it didn’t stop me starting something I’m very passionate about.&amp;nbsp;I really enjoy hanging out with developers and getting to know them better. For me, what mattered most was to launch a product that would serve this market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a developer, I know how much developers love to use free tools. However, they’re also willing to pay for a product that provides significant value to their flow and productivity. I want Cronhub to be one of these tools.&amp;nbsp;I launched Cronhub with only two plans, “Free” and “Developer ($7/month)”. I wanted to see whether this was something other developers would pay for or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very first pricing model was mostly a symbolic strategy to validate my idea. I didn’t spend much time thinking about the pricing plan and followed Cost-Plus pricing strategy to use the monitor count as a divider between the free and the paid plan. In the first month, I got a couple of paid customers which made me revisit my pricing.&amp;nbsp;That’s when I’ decided to invest a little bit of time to learn about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two months of reading and seeking advice from product people, I’ve come up with these key learnings that I’ve applied to Cronhub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;0ac4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t give up too many things in the free&amp;nbsp;plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to give up too much in the free plan, especially in the beginning. It’s quite possible that your product doesn’t offer any free plan.&amp;nbsp;But for Cronhub, I wanted to use this channel as a way to acquire customers. Limit the free plan to the minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;1eb2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your customer&amp;nbsp;groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing your customers is important, because it helps you understand how much they can afford to pay for your product.&amp;nbsp;Cronhub’s free and developer plans are intended only for solo developers who have projects on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now also have two team plans: “Startup $19/month” and “Business $49/month,” and they are intended for engineering teams.&amp;nbsp;Engineering teams should collaborate together, so the team support is necessary. Team sizes are different and that’s why I’ve priced these plans by the number of team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;8788&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about your conversion flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picturing the customer conversion flow in your head is really helpful in understanding how pricing may work, and that’s why I’ve decided to offer a free plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine the flow like this: a developer signs up for the free plan to use it for their personal projects. If they like my product very much, the chances are high that they will also promote my product within their company. It’s the word-of-mouth effect. Now someone from their company signs up to try the team plan, and there you have your potential lead who is very likely to become a customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;93fa&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your pricing is probably too&amp;nbsp;cheap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to raise your prices. We tend to undervalue our product, because we are afraid that no one will pay if it’s expensive. This is true especially for people who don’t have experience with pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, pricing your project very cheap may discredit the value your product provides.&amp;nbsp;It can make people question the quality of your product.That’s why you want to find the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sweet spot&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;where it’s not cheap and also not expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {&quot;level&quot;:4} --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;265a&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing will affect your long-term productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a single person team, then you probably do the product support as well. Higher paying customers tend to create fewer support requests compared to the customers who have signed up for the lowest pricing plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about your time and how you want to spend it. If you’re planning to stay a one-person team, then this will make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Cronhub, eventually, I’m thinking I’ll only have two plans: a free plan and a business plan. The free plan will be for developers and the business plan for small and medium-sized engineering teams.&amp;nbsp;Instead of having many low paying customers (and spending many hours answering support questions), I would prefer having a small number of high paying customers (and enjoy building a product).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
